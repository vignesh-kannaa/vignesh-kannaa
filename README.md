## Data Science Projects
## Machine Learning:
### Regression
### Classification 
* [Diabetes Prediction](https://github.com/vignesh-kannaa/ml-Diabetes_Prediction) : The diabetes prediction project utilizes dataset analysis, machine learning models, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble methods to accurately predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes. By applying various ML techniques and optimizing model parameters, this project aims to provide reliable predictions and assist in early detection and management of diabetes.
* [Credit Risk Prediction](https://github.com/vignesh-kannaa/ml-unsupervised-customer-segmentation) : Credit risk prediction using supervised machine learning involves training algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests, with labeled data to build models that can accurately assess the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan, aiding financial institutions in making informed lending decisions and managing risks effectively.

### Clustering 
* [Mall Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/vignesh-kannaa/ml-unsupervised-customer-segmentation) : Customer segmentation using unsupervised learning algorithms leverages techniques like clustering, such as k-means or hierarchical clustering, to group customers based on similarities in their behavior, demographics, or preferences, enabling businesses to tailor their marketing strategies and offerings for different segments effectively.

## Deep Learning 
### Computer Vision(CV)
* [Anime Character Prediction](https://github.com/vignesh-kannaa/dl-cnn-Anime_Character_Prediction) : CNN based image classification project specializes in accurately classifying characters from the popular series "One Piece". By uploading an image of any desired character
* [Custom Object Detection using Yolo](https://github.com/vignesh-kannaa/dl-yolo-Custom_object_detection) : Detecting a custom object in static images and videos using YOLOv7 involves utilizing the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm trained with the custom dataset of Jack Sparrow images. This enables accurate detection and localization of Jack Sparrow in both images and video footage, enabling various applications such as tracking or analysis.

### Natural Language Processing(NLP)
* [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/vignesh-kannaa/dl-nlp-Sentiment_analysis_movie_review) :  This utilises BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model in conjunction with TensorFlow to analyze and classify the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of movie reviews, enabling accurate sentiment assessment for better understanding of audience opinions and feedback.
* [Text Generation](https://github.com/vignesh-kannaa/dl-nlp-Text_generation) : The TensorFlow-based project leverages the Shakespear dataset to train a language model capable of generating text in the style of William Shakespeare. With this project, users can witness the model's creativity in generating unique and poetic passages reminiscent of the renowned playwright's literary works.
* [Movie Recommendation](https://github.com/vignesh-kannaa/ml-movie_recommendation) : The movie recommendation system utilizing cosine similarity analyzes the similarity between users' movie preferences to suggest films with comparable attributes, enhancing personalized viewing experiences.

### Generative Adversarial Network(GAN)
* [Number Generation](https://github.com/vignesh-kannaa/dl-gan-DCGAN-Number-Generation) : By utilizing TensorFlow's DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) architecture and training it on the MNIST dataset, it becomes possible to generate realistic and visually coherent handwritten digit images, showcasing the model's ability to learn and produce new numerical representations.
